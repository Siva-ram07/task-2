⚠️ Not a legitimate Microsoft domain.

Urgent and Fear-Based Language

“High-severity alert has been triggered”

Designed to pressure the user into acting fast without thinking.

Misleading Button

"View alert details" could link to a fake login or malware site.

Real alert buttons should lead to Microsoft-secured domains.

These are major red flags in professional security emails.

Generic Signature

Signed as “The Office 365 Team” — lacks personal contact or ticket ID.

Remember: good design ≠ safe email.
