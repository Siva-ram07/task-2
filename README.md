Phishing Characteristics Identified:
Suspicious Sender Email

From: microsoft@email-records.com

Not a legitimate Microsoft domain.

Urgent and Fear-Based Language

“High-severity alert has been triggered”

Designed to pressure the user into acting fast without thinking.

"View alert details" could link to a fake login or malware site.

Real alert buttons should lead to Microsoft-secured domains.

Sender: Unknown

Recipient: missing

These are major red flags in professional security emails.

Signed as “The Office 365 Team” — lacks personal contact or ticket ID.

Email received at 4:22 PM but references an event at 9:22 PM — odd and possibly fabricated.

Uses Office 365 logo and branding to appear authentic.

Remember: good design ≠ safe email.
